#RPS Duel
###_Go talk to someone_

Have you noticed that this age of social networks has done a great job of discouraging actual person-to-person interaction? Our status as a person is defined by how much stuff we've expelled from behind our computer or mobile screens, and how much approval that stuff has received from our "friends" via their computer and mobiles screens. Actually talking to someone face-to-face is an activity of a bygone era... or is it?
Obviously there's something missing. The addition of these websites and games have come at the cost of other activities, and we need something big in order to bring back what we've lost. We need...
##RPS Duel
It's
* the ONLY game that encourages spending time with your friends - while totally destroying them!
* the ONLY game where the more people you interact with, the better your score.
* the ONLY game that you can use to settle arguments.

It's RPS Duel - same great taste, now with half the fat.

###What is it?
"But Danyl," you say, adoration filling your gaze as the snow falls lily-white upon your head, "what _is_ RPS Duel?" "It's a game," I answer, "and so much more. It's the crisp scent of the first rain of a brand new spring, reminding you that every winter must come to an end. It's the soft cry of a new-born child, at once both ear-piercing and beautiful. It's a metaphor that says nothing about what it actually is. It's RPS Duel."

##For Real, Though
RPS Duel is essentially an ongoing Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament. There's no centralized server - your ranking is only relative to the people you compete with. Once you end a duel with someone and go your separate ways, you won't even know how they're doing until you duel them again - or just ask them. Like I said, "go talk to someone."

As you win duels, you gain points. But lose a duel, and you'll lose points. You can also gain points in other ways - by duelling new people, or inviting people to the app. However, spend too much time without varying who you duel, and you'll start to lose points. The idea is to get you out, interacting with people. That's why there's also no duelling over the internet - only local WiFi networks, bluetooth, and NFC.

As you gain points, you level up. Levelling up means you get new things - mainly more "weapon sets," such as RPS 5 and RPS 7. Those weapon sets can only be used against people who also have them unlocked, so it's a good idea to encourage your friends to keep playing so you can try out everything the game has to offer. You should also definitely worry about losing points, because your level can go down and you can end up losing things that you'd previously unlocked. So keep playing - and keep winning.
